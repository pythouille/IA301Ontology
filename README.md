# Ontology: Fruits and vegetables
## Seasonality and locality for a better consumption

This project was realized by Iliana Vincenti, Louis Couturier and Ange Valli in the scope of "IA301:Logics and Symbolic AI" course at ENSTA Paris, under the supervision of Natalia Diaz Rodriguez.

## Description

Nowadays, people try to change their consumption to reduce their ecological footprint. The goal of our ontology is to help a most eco-friendly consumption of fruits and vegetables. The knowledge gathered in the ontology enables a user to choose local and seasonal fruits and vegetables according to their tastes and nutritional properties.

This ontology is centered on the four weather seasons of Western Europe and localities are specified by countries or regions of Metropolitan France. We made the choice to center it in France and in Europe as we want to encourage people to consume local food. Hence, it falls within the scope of the 12th United Nations Sustainable Development Goal, tackling in particular the problem B9 : “Supporting local entrepreneurs and fair trade”. 

Most of the data originates from https://www.lesfruitsetlegumesfrais.com/. All the components are available with both English and French labels.
